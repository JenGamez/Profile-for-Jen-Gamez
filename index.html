                  In 2013 I opened a law firm with my partner at the time. He was the
                  attorney and I was everything else – human resources,
                  accounting, management, and marketing. I love marketing and
                  it’s been my career for 12 years. What I haven’t liked from
                  the get-go is that I have to hire digital marketing
                  consultants to make my content, SEO and design ideas come to
                  life. For years I’ve wanted to know how to do it all - the
                  back-end and the front-end. So, I am doing it! I am enrolled
                  in the UCSD Extension Coding Boot Camp to become a Full Stack
                  Developer. It’s a very intense six- month course that scares
                  the hell out of me, and I freakin’ love it! Like a friend said
                  to me the other day, “If your dreams don’t scare you, they
                  aren’t big enough.”

              <p class="Par2">
                When I am not coding, I like to run, write, cook, hang out
                with friends, and see live music. Most of all, I love being a
                mom to my three kids - ages 7, 11, and 14. They are pretty
                much the most amazing people on the planet, in my humble
                opinion.
