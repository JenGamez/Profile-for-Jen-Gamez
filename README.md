# Unit 01: HTML, CSS, and Git Homework: Portfolio

## Description

This project is a beginner coders first time to build a professional portfolio site. The site is a portfolio for coding student Jen Gamez. There are three pages included in this Porfolio - About Me, Portfolio, and Contact. An HTML document was first created for each page. They were styled by a linked CSS file.  

There were some challenges in building this site including space under the header, not getting the background image to appear, and quite a few formatting issues.  The Porfolio page is incomplete.

The goal of this Portfolio, if it were up to standard, would be for an employer to learn about the developer, view their work and contact them.

## Installation
